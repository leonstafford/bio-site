Passionate about:

## Open source developer specialising in static website performance optimisation


Creator of [WP Static Site Generator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/) a plugin that solves some security, performance and cost issues with WordPress websites.


### My development tooling

I write code in [Vim](https://www.vim.org/). As per the sound advice from [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer), learn one text editor well, manipulating text is an every day thing. Aim to be good, be fast and enjoy it!

tmux gives me multiple terminal windows and panes within each window. 

Git keeps my content under version control and, amongst many other things, prevents loss of data.

Give me those 3 tools and I'm happy. They'll run on any PC from the last 20 years or older. 


### Essays

A sampling of my writings touching on human behaviour and philosophy:


 - [The true cost of everything](/essays/true_cost/) Should vegans become rocks to minimize their impact on the earth and our ears?
 - [What I believe](/essays/what_i_believe/) Proofless acceptance and self-justification  
 - [Focusing at different levels](/essays/focusing_at_different_levels/) Being social, spiritual or primal
 - [Short distance relationships](/essays/short_distance_relationships/) Can't live with/out them? live close to them
 - [Persuasion for humanity](/essays/persuasion_for_humanity/) Not all advertising has to be evil
 - [Business to feed the family](/essays/business_to_feed_the_family/) Does the greed for extra profit margins cause more damage to the ecosystem?
