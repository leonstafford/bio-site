Notes on getting connected to 3G/4G in Thailand on the dtac prepaid SIM

```
obsd# gammu identify
Device               : /dev/cuaU0
Manufacturer         : Huawei
Model                : E3372 (E3372)
Firmware             : 22.329.63.00.74
IMEI                 : 866785033700732
SIM IMSI             : 520050314388175
```

Example `smsd.conf`

```
loglevel = 7

user = _smsd

pidfile = /var/run/smsd/smsd.pid
infofile = /var/run/smsd/smsd.info

logfile = /var/log/smsd/smsd.log

[GSM1]
device = /dev/cuaU0

init = AT^CURC=0

# For this one I have set incoming=no so it doesn't pull
# the existing messages off the phone.
incoming = no
rtscts = no
baudrate = 115200
eventhandler = /home/leon/smstoolsevents.sh
send_delay = 20
```

And a simple script to log events `/home/leon/smstoolsevents.sh`

```


#!/bin/ksh

# script to react to events, like receiving an SMS

echo '' >> /home/leon/logsmsevents
echo 'received a message' >> /home/leon/logsmsevents


```

`smsd` log with above settings gives the following when `smsd` is restarted:

and continues to poll 


Now, we need to set up pppd. Assuming that no received activation SMS is due to not registering on the data network yet, so leaving smsd running and will attempt the ppd setup


Much talk is had about HiLink mode vs Stick mode. 

I decided to figure out what mine was being detected as:

```
obsd# usbdevs
Controller /dev/usb0:
addr 01: 8086:0000 Intel, xHCI root hub
addr 02: 12d1:1442 HUAWEI_MOBILE, HUAWEI_MOBILE
addr 03: 05ac:12aa Apple Inc., iPod
Controller /dev/usb1:
addr 01: 8086:0000 Intel, EHCI root hub
addr 02: 8087:8000 Intel, Rate Matching Hub
addr 03: 04f3:012d ELAN, Touchscreen
addr 04: 04ca:7036 SC20A38485AA4C8E3D, Integrated Camera
```

Based on the above, it looks like we're already operating in Stick mode, with `12d1:1442`, else assuming the support in umsm in OpenBSD for this device is handling the USB modeswitching automagically...


Setting up the pppd stuff

I have 

/etc/ppp/peers/e3372:

```
cuaU0
115200
debug
noauth
nocrtscts
:10.254.254.1
ipcp-accept-remote

demand
active-filter 'not udp port 123'
persist
idle 600
connect "/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/ppp/dtac-chat"

```

/etc/ppp/dtac-chat:
```
TIMEOUT 10
REPORT CONNECT

ABORT 'NO CARRIER'
ABORT ERROR
'' ATZ OK AT&F OK
AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","www.dtac.co.th" OK
ATD*99***1# CONNECT

```


/etc/ppp/chap-secrets
```
# Secrets for authentication using CHAP
# client        server  secret                  IP addresses
isp@cingulargprs.com    *       CINGULAR1

```



Finally, run `ifconfig ppp0 create` (should be showing in ifconfig now) and then `pppd e3372 call`

This doesn't give me much, so I tail `/var/log/daemon`, resulting in:

```
Dec 13 13:09:29 obsd pppd[80914]: pppd 2.3.5 started by leon, uid 0
Dec 13 13:09:29 obsd pppd[80914]: ioctl(TIOCSETD): Device not configured

```
